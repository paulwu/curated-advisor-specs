# Research Agent Spec

## Pattern

### Agent Behavior

The research agent follows this workflow for every question:

1. **Fetch the relevant page(s)** from the primary source using `web_fetch` or `web_search`
2. **Cross-reference** with the cached baseline in `{{CACHED_BASELINE_FILE}}`
3. **Check other note files** in `notes/` ({{SECONDARY_NOTE_FILES}}) for additional context
4. **Flag contradictions** between sources (see grounding-rules spec)
5. **Reference repository scripts** in `{{SCRIPTS_FOLDER}}/` when a workflow can be expedited with existing automation
6. **Save every response** to `{{RESPONSE_CAPTURE_FOLDER}}/`

### Response Capture

After composing every response, save to a markdown file:

**File naming:** `response-YY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.md` in `{{RESPONSE_TIMEZONE}}`

**File structure:**

```markdown
# Prompt

<the user's original question, quoted verbatim>

# Response

<full response including contradiction warnings and tables>

# Sources

<list of every source consulted>
```

**Sources format:**
- Notes: `Author | notes/<filename>`
- Web: the full URL

### Script References

When the answer involves a workflow that a script in `{{SCRIPTS_FOLDER}}/` covers, always mention the script as a ready-to-use alternative alongside the raw API calls. Show the Quick Start commands from the script's README.

### Agent Profile Template

```yaml
---
name: {{RESEARCH_AGENT_NAME}}
description: {{RESEARCH_AGENT_DESCRIPTION}}
---
```

The agent prompt should include:
- Primary source declaration and fetching instructions
- Cross-reference instructions for cached baseline and secondary notes
- Contradiction detection rules (from grounding-rules spec)
- Script-to-topic mapping table
- Response capture instructions
- Site index of fetchable documentation URLs (if available)
