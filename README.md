# Curated Advisor Specs

A [spec-driven development](docs/spec-driven-development/README.md) framework for building **knowledge repositories with trusted, grounded AI agents** — where every answer traces back to sources you control.

Standard chatbots hallucinate freely. These specs define a different model: agents that follow strict source hierarchies, detect contradictions against your curated knowledge, and cite their sources — giving you far greater control over what the AI says and why. Each spec captures a battle-tested pattern (grounding rules, wizard flows, research pipelines, documentation architecture) as a parameterized template you can import into any repository.

**The feedback loop:** Use these specs to scaffold a new knowledge repo. As you refine patterns in your project, extract the improvements back into specs here — so every repo in the ecosystem benefits.

## Available Specs

| Spec | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| [`grounding-rules`](specs/grounding-rules.spec.md) | Source priority hierarchy, contradiction detection, citation format |
| [`notes-conventions`](specs/notes-conventions.spec.md) | YAML frontmatter (`Author`, `Priority`), priority scale (1-5+) |
| [`wizard-agent`](specs/wizard-agent.spec.md) | Prerequisite checks, `az account show` detection, autopilot warning, command generation |
| [`research-agent`](specs/research-agent.spec.md) | Fetch live docs, cross-reference cached notes, flag contradictions, save response |
| [`doc-architecture`](specs/doc-architecture.spec.md) | `notes/` → `docs/` → `scripts/` three-layer architecture |
| [`readme-structure`](specs/readme-structure.spec.md) | README with TOC, collapsible folder tree, agent table, prerequisite warnings |

## Quick Start

### 1. Copy the meta-agents into your project

**Option A — From a local clone of this repo:**

```bash
mkdir -p your-project/.github/agents
cp .github/agents/Spec-Importer.agent.md your-project/.github/agents/
cp .github/agents/Spec-Drift.agent.md    your-project/.github/agents/
```

**Option B — Download from GitHub (no clone needed):**

Run this from your project's root directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/agents
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulwu/curated-advisor-specs/main/.github/agents/Spec-Importer.agent.md -o .github/agents/Spec-Importer.agent.md
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulwu/curated-advisor-specs/main/.github/agents/Spec-Drift.agent.md    -o .github/agents/Spec-Drift.agent.md
```

> **Note:** You only need to copy the agents manually the first time. After that, `@spec-importer` will automatically sync the latest agent files from the spec repo on every import.

### 2. Import specs (interactive mode — press Shift+Tab first)

The importer auto-downloads specs from GitHub — no local clone needed:

```
@spec-importer Import grounding-rules and research-agent
```

If the agent can't reach GitHub, point it to a local clone instead:

```
@spec-importer Import grounding-rules and research-agent specs from ~/curated-advisor-specs/specs/
```

The importer collects your project-specific values (URLs, folder names, agent names) and generates the corresponding files — including a lightweight `docs/spec-driven-development.md` guide that links back to the full documentation here.

### 3. Check for drift later

```
@spec-drift Compare this project against its imported specs
```

## Projects Using These Specs

| Project | Specs Imported |
|---|---|

```

Specs flow **into** projects via `@spec-importer`. Pattern improvements flow **back** via `@spec-exporter`. `@spec-drift` keeps everything in sync.

## How It Was Built

These specs were extracted from the [agent365-management](https://github.com/paulwu/agent365-management) project — a knowledge base for Microsoft Agent 365 / Entra Agent ID. The patterns (source hierarchies, contradiction detection, wizard flows) evolved through iterative development and were generalized into parameterized specs so any repository can adopt and improve them.
